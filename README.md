# ðŸ§® Assignment2_Conditionals

This is the **second repository I ever created on GitHub** â€” during the time I began learning **C++** and took my first formal steps into **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## ðŸ“œ Background

- Back in my **first semester**, I had already learned **C programming** from YouTube and practiced it extensively.
- But I used to run everything on **online compilers** like OnlineGDB â€” and **never saved any of my code**, so I have no record of that phase.
- This repo was created when I joined the **"C++ with DSA â€“ Feb'24" batch** â€” which marked the start of my proper **tech journey**.
- I learned how to set up **VS Code** for the first time in that batch.
- And most importantly â€” I created this **GitHub account** because of this very assignment.

## ðŸŽ¯ About This Repo

- This assignment covers **basic conditional logic in C++**.
- It may look small, but for me â€” it was a **huge step forward**.
- This is where I moved from **casual code learning** to **tracked, committed learning**.

## ðŸ§¾ Final Note

This is not just code â€” it's where it all began.  
**The first repo. The first push. The beginning of my dev journey.**
